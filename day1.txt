Data in DBMS is:

A collection of raw facts that are stored in a structured format to be retrieved, modified, and processed by a database.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
Imagine a student database. The data could include:

Student Name: "Parth Saini"

Roll Number: 102

Course: "Computer Science"

Marks: 88

Each of these values is data, and when organized in a structured table, they become information useful for queries and reports.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Data in DBMS:
Numeric data â€“ e.g., age, marks, salary

Text data â€“ e.g., names, addresses

Date/time data â€“ e.g., DOB, timestamps

Boolean data â€“ true/false values

ðŸ”¹ How is Data Stored?
In tables (rows and columns)

Each row = one record (e.g., one student)

Each column = one attribute/field (e.g., name, age)

Let me know if youâ€™d like a diagram or explanation of how data is organized in tables.


 What is a File System?
A file system is a method and structure used by an operating system to store, organize, retrieve, and manage data on a storage device like a hard drive, SSD, or USB drive.

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
A file system is a way of organizing and storing files on a storage medium, allowing users and programs to easily access and manage data.

ðŸ”¹ Functions of a File System:
Organize files into directories/folders

Track file locations on the disk

Control access (permissions, read/write)

Manage metadata (file name, size, date created, etc.)

Support file operations â€“ create, read, write, delete, etc.




The main types of databases used in database management systems (DBMS):

ðŸ”¹ 1. Relational Database (RDBMS)
Stores data in tables (rows and columns)

Tables can be linked using keys (Primary Key, Foreign Key)

Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)

âœ… Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server
âœ… Use Case: Banking systems, student databases, inventory management

ðŸ”¹ 2. NoSQL Database
Non-tabular; stores data in formats like:

Key-Value

Document

Column-Family

Graph

Good for big data, real-time apps, and unstructured data

âœ… Example: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (column), Neo4j (graph)
âœ… Use Case: Social networks, IoT, recommendation systems

ðŸ”¹ 3. Hierarchical Database
Data is organized in a tree-like structure (parent-child relationships)

Fast access but not flexible for complex relationships

âœ… Example: IBM IMS
âœ… Use Case: File systems, legacy systems

ðŸ”¹ 4. Network Database
Similar to hierarchical, but allows many-to-many relationships using a graph structure

More flexible than hierarchical

âœ… Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS), TurboIMAGE
âœ… Use Case: Telecom, transport networks

ðŸ”¹ 5. Object-Oriented Database
Stores data as objects (as in object-oriented programming)

Supports features like inheritance, classes, polymorphism

âœ… Example: db4o, ObjectDB
âœ… Use Case: CAD/CAM systems, real-time systems, multimedia applications

ðŸ”¹ 6. Distributed Database
Data is stored across multiple physical locations (different computers or networks)

Appears as a single database to users

âœ… Example: Apache Cassandra, Google Spanner
âœ… Use Case: Global applications, cloud-based systems

ðŸ”¹ 7. Cloud Database
Hosted on a cloud platform (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

Scalable, accessible from anywhere, pay-as-you-use model

âœ… Example: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Firestore, Azure SQL
âœ… Use Case: Web apps, SaaS platforms

ðŸ”¹ 8. Graph Database
Designed to store data in nodes and edges (representing entities and their relationships)

Efficient for relationship-heavy queries



 What is Data Modeling?
Data Modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of data and its relationships, used to design how data will be stored, organized, and accessed in a database.

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
Data modeling is the process of defining and structuring data elements and their relationships for a specific business purpose, usually in the form of diagrams like ER (Entity-Relationship) models.

ðŸ”¹ Why is Data Modeling Important?
Helps understand what data is needed and how it should be stored

Ensures data consistency, accuracy, and efficiency

Acts as a blueprint before building the actual database

ðŸ”¹ Levels of Data Modeling:
Level	Description	Example
1. Conceptual	High-level model showing main entities and relationships	e.g., Student â†” Enrolls â†” Course
2. Logical	More detailed: includes attributes, primary/foreign keys, but not DBMS-specific	e.g., Student(Name, Roll No, Dept)
3. Physical	Actual implementation in a specific DBMS (includes tables, datatypes, indexes)	e.g., CREATE TABLE statements in SQL

ðŸ”¹ Common Tools for Data Modeling:
ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram)

UML Class Diagrams

Tools: dbdiagram.io, Lucidchart, ER/Studio, Oracle SQL Developer

ðŸ”¹ Key Terms in Data Modeling:
Entity: A real-world object (e.g., Student, Teacher)

Attribute: A property of an entity (e.g., Name, Age)

Relationship: Association between entities (e.g., Student enrolls in Course)

Primary Key: Unique identifier for a record

Foreign Key: A reference to a primary key in another table


What are Relational Databases?
A Relational Database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in the form of tables (also called relations). It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to access and manage the data.

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
A relational database is a database that stores data in rows and columns within tables, and allows relationships between data using keys.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Tables (Relations): Data is stored in structured tables.

Rows (Records): Each row is a unique record.

Columns (Fields): Each column represents an attribute of the data.

Primary Key: A unique identifier for each row in a table.

Foreign Key: A field that links one table to another, creating relationships.
